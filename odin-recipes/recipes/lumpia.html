  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Lumpiang Shanghai is a popular Filipino appetizer, often referred to as Filipino spring rolls or Filipino egg
    rolls. It's a delightful and flavorful dish that's loved for its crispy exterior and savory filling.</p>
  <p>The filling typically consists of ground pork or a combination of ground pork and shrimp, mixed with finely chopped
    vegetables such as carrots, onions, and garlic. This mixture is seasoned with soy sauce, salt, and pepper, creating
    a well-balanced and savory flavor profile. The filling is then carefully wrapped in thin spring roll wrappers,
    creating small, tightly rolled cylinders.</p>
  <p>Once the lumpia are assembled, they are deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. The result is a delicious
    combination of textures, with the crunchy exterior contrasting beautifully with the tender, savory filling. Lumpiang
    Shanghai is often served with a dipping sauce, such as sweet chili sauce or a vinegar-based dipping sauce, adding an
    extra layer of flavor to this beloved Filipino appetizer. It's a crowd-pleaser at parties and gatherings, making it
    a favorite finger food in Filipino cuisine.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) package lumpia wrappers</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
    <li>⅓ cup finely chopped onion</li>
    <li>⅓ cup finely chopped green bell pepper</li>
    <li>⅓ cup finely chopped carrot</li>
    <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Make sure the lumpia wrappers are completely thawed. Lay several out on a clean dry surface and cover with a
      damp towel. The wrappers are very thin and the edges will dry out quickly.</li>
    <li>
      In a medium bowl, blend together the ground beef and pork, onion, green pepper and carrot. Place about 2
      tablespoons of the meat mixture along the center of the wrapper. The filling should be no bigger around than your
      thumb or the wrapper will burn before the meat is cooked. Fold one edge of the wrapper over to the other. Fold the
      outer edges in slightly, then continue to roll into a cylinder. Wet your finger, and moisten the edge to seal.
      Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling, keeping finished lumpias covered to prevent drying. This is a good
      time to recruit a friend or loved one to make the job less repetitive!!
    </li>
    <li>Heat oil in a 9 inch skillet at medium to medium high heat until oil is 365 to 375 degrees F (170 to 175 degrees
      C) Fry 3-4 lumpia at a time. It should only take about 2-3 minutes for each side. The lumpia will be nicely
      browned when done. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    <li>You can cut each lumpia into thirds for parties, if you like. In the Philippines, lumpia was eaten with banana
      ketchup, but I've never seen it sold in America.</li>
